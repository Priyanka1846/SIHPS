## Problem Title
SIH1392 E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
In today’s digital age, the use of electronic devices — including smartphones, laptops, TVs, and home appliances — has skyrocketed. Along with this technological boom comes a pressing issue: electronic waste (e-waste). According to global studies, millions of tons of e-waste are generated annually, yet only a fraction is properly recycled.

A major reason behind improper disposal is the lack of public knowledge and accessibility regarding authorized recycling centers. Many people either throw away old electronics with regular trash or resort to selling them informally, where safe recycling practices are not followed. This contributes to environmental damage, human health hazards (due to the toxic materials in e-waste like lead, cadmium, and mercury), and the loss of valuable reusable materials (like gold, silver, and copper found in electronics).

Despite the efforts of local governments and environmental agencies to set up recycling facilities, users often face challenges:

They don't know where these facilities are located.

Information about facilities (what items they accept, operating hours, services provided) is scattered and unreliable.

Facilities vary significantly in the type and condition of items they accept.

There is no unified platform to connect users to verified, trustworthy recycling points.

Thus, there is an urgent need for a centralized, easy-to-use system that helps users find nearby certified e-waste disposal and recycling centers — ensuring convenient, responsible, and environmentally friendly disposal of their old electronics.

## Idea
The E-Waste Facility Locator is envisioned as a mobile and web application that empowers users to quickly locate the nearest certified e-waste recycling centers based on their location.

The platform would act as a bridge between individuals and recycling facilities by:

Mapping out nearby centers in a user-friendly manner.

Filtering facilities based on the type of waste accepted (phones, batteries, laptops, TVs, kitchen appliances, etc.).

Providing detailed facility profiles, including address, working hours, contact information, accepted items, certifications, and service offerings (pickup available, drop-off points, discounts, etc.).

Allowing users to submit feedback, reviews, and report new facilities that can later be verified by admins.

Educating users about proper e-waste disposal through blogs, tips, and campaigns.

Sending notifications about e-waste drives or collection campaigns happening near them.

The idea is to incentivize responsible behavior and streamline the disposal process so that more e-waste can be properly recycled or refurbished.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The solution would include:

Mobile App and Website: For easy access by everyday users.

Admin Dashboard: For e-waste agencies or admins to manage facility listings and monitor reports.

Geo-location Services: Integration with Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to pinpoint user location and suggest facilities nearby.

Search & Filter Engine: Helps users find centers based on criteria like type of item, distance, services offered.

Notification and Alert System: To keep users informed about events, campaigns, or news related to e-waste management.

User Feedback Loop: Allow users to rate and report facilities for accuracy and quality assurance.

Security Layer: Ensuring all data transactions (user data, locations, reviews) are safe and encrypted.

## Use Cases:
1.Locate Nearest E-Waste Facility

User enables location or enters an address to view a map/list of nearby certified centers.

2.Facility Details

Tapping on a facility shows detailed information like address, working hours, contact, accepted types of e-waste, services like free pickup, etc.

3.Filter Search

Users can apply filters based on the type of e-waste they wish to dispose of (e.g., batteries, mobile phones, computers, household appliances).

4.Navigation Assistance

Integration with maps allows users to directly navigate from their current location to the selected facility.

5.Submit New Facility

Users can recommend a facility they know but which is not listed. This goes through an admin verification process.

6.Report Problems

Users can report issues like closed centers, wrong addresses, or bad service which admins will review.

7.Admin Portal

Admins can add, remove, and edit facility information, verify user-submitted entries, and manage reported facilities.

8.Push Notifications

Users receive timely notifications about nearby collection drives, facility updates, tips for better e-waste disposal, and reward programs.
